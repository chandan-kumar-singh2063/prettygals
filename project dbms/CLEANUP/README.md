# PROJECT CLEANUP GUIDE

## üìÅ CLEANUP Folder Contents

This folder contains scripts and documentation for cleaning up your project.

### Files:
- `FILES_TO_DELETE.md` - Detailed list of files identified for removal
- `cleanup-project.ps1` - Interactive cleanup script with confirmations
- `quick-cleanup.ps1` - Fast cleanup without prompts

## üöÄ How to Run

### Option 1: Interactive Cleanup (Recommended for first time)
```powershell
.\cleanup-project.ps1
```
- Shows progress and asks for confirmation
- Safer option with detailed feedback

### Option 2: Quick Cleanup
```powershell
.\quick-cleanup.ps1
```
- Fast execution without prompts
- Use when you're sure about the cleanup

### Option 3: One-liner (Copy-paste this in PowerShell)
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser -Force; cd "CLEANUP"; .\quick-cleanup.ps1
```

## üìã What Gets Removed

### ‚úÖ SAFE TO DELETE:
- **Test Files**: 8 test pages and debug utilities
- **Duplicate Files**: 5 files with `_new` suffix  
- **Development APIs**: Seed data and testing endpoints
- **Cache Files**: Old webpack cache files
- **Documentation**: Example files and development scripts

### ‚ùå PROTECTED FILES:
- Your main application code
- Payment system files
- Database models (working versions)
- Configuration files
- Dependencies

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Backup First**: Though we've identified safe files, consider backing up if needed
2. **No Functional Impact**: These removals won't affect your working application
3. **Size Reduction**: Will significantly reduce project clutter
4. **Git Clean**: Run `git status` after cleanup to see what changed

## üîÑ After Cleanup

1. Test your application: `npm run dev`
2. Verify payment system still works
3. Check that no important functionality is broken
4. Commit the cleanup: `git add . && git commit -m "Clean up test files and duplicates"`

## üìä Expected Results

- **~20+ files/folders removed**
- **Cleaner project structure**
- **Reduced confusion from duplicate files**
- **Easier navigation and maintenance**
- **No functional changes to your app**
